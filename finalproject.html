Designers
Items checked:
Pair values of colors together (not only hues) to increase contrast
Don't rely on sensory characteristics as the sole indicator for understanding and operating content
Design focus states to help users navigate and understand where they are
Be as consistent and clear as possible in layout and copy

Items not checked:
Make sure there is enough contrast between text and its background color
Don't indicate important information using color alone
Help users understand inputs, and help them avoid and correct mistakes
Write good alt text for your images
If an experience cannot be made accessible, create another route for users to get that information


Contrast:
There was not enough contrast in the navigation panel or in the tiled links. The background is too dark and the text is blue. Making the text white and making the background color a darker blue will fix this problem. The aqua-colored text on a blue background also does not pass the contrast test on Wave. Making the background darker blue for this text will also fix this problem. Luckily the school colors naturally contrast quite a bit, so the hues are working well to highlight information.

Alt text:
	All of the images had alt text. Some alt text for images was very descriptive, such as "a group of Michigan graduates at commencement." Other alt-text however did not make sense. For some images, the alt text reads "commencement 3" instead of "poster for commencement events," or "list of commencement events". Another reads "stop human trafficking FBI" instead of "poster for Human Trafficking Symposium".

Important Information:
	There is a lot of emphasis on color within the website to indicate important information, such as the navigation or headings on the tiled content which represent events. Though there's slight differences in sizing between the text, most of it is very similar-looking and bolded. Perhaps this information should have greater differences in sizing in order to more easily show to those who cannot distinguish colors which text is the title of the event and which is the supplementary information about the event.

Help Users Understand Inputs:
	Several of the secondary pages have a left-side wrap of filter sections, each of which has event search checkboxes for the event type, event "tags" (which I'm not sure what it means, even), event group, and event location. There's no text or instruction describing this aside, and the design of the website seems to position the purpose of the aside as self-evident- you check the items that you're looking for. This isn't super-intuitive, however, and it would be good to have some description for the user to know what the inputs mean before they trial and error certain "tags", for example. Even a short sentence saying "Find an event based on filter options", would be helpful, but really each section of filters should be clarified.

Make the Experience Accessible:
	The website has a map on one of its pages. This does not have any accessibility component to it for those that may not be able to access it. The map tells Mac users to use Command + Scroll to use the map, but this action is not supportable for those who may have fine motor impairment and may not be able to perform that action. The map page does not have any accompanying text or explanation as to what it is, so this should be changed. Perhaps events located on campus could also be listed below the map in text form. It would be neat if each of the buildings that had events were displayed as headers on the page with each event listed below it.
