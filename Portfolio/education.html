  <p>Bees have been the source of fascination for thousands of years. Revered for their production of the honeycomb from nectar, some ancient cultures have actually worshipped bees or had myths surrounding them. Often seen as "ambrosia" or "nectar of the gods", honey has often been seen as a mystical food item for its sweetness as well as its seemingly magical appearance in the hives of bees.

  In ancient Egypt, bees were seen as prodigious and indicative of the afterlife. Pharoahs and other royalty often had representations of the insects in their tomb as well, while Sumerian hieroglyphics depict a bee goddess. Greeks revered bees as early as the Bronze Age, which was 1800 to 1700 BC.

    <p>According to Greek myth, the god Aristaeus brought beekeeping to Ancient Greece. The son of a human woman, Cyrene, and the god Apollo, Hermes brought Aristaeus to be fed on nectar and ambrosia to give him divinity. Nymphs taught him how to keep bees, and according to legend Aristaeus brought about a colony's rebirth through an ox hide.
    <br>In the Hindu religion, the goddess Bhramari Devi had a swarm of black bees. In the tenth book and thirteenth chapter of the <a href="http://sacred-texts.com/hin/db/bk10ch13.htm#page_1046">Devi Bhagavata Purana</a>, Bhramari is described as such:
"Her body was decked with various ornaments and in the fists of Her hands there were wonderful rows of hornets ( large black bees). Her one hand was ready to grant boons and Her other hand was ready to hold out “no fear.” On the neck of  Bhagavatî, the Ocean of Mercy, and peaceful, were seen the variegated garlands with large black bees all round. Those male and female bees singing incessantly all round Her the Hrîmkâra Mantra (the First Vibration of Force), kotis of black bees surrounded Her. The All-auspicious Bhagavatî, praised by all the Vedas, Who is all in all, composed of all, Who is all good, the Mother of all, Omniscient, the Protectress of all, was adorned fully with dress."

    <br><h2>State of Pollinators Today</h2>
    <p>Today bee populations across North America and the world have been declining. Record numbers of colonies have been wiped out due to Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). Scientists and wildlife biologists do not know the cause of CCD, with some pinning the blame on neonicotinoids. Some news media report that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/28/total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides-likely-after-major-new-eu-analysis">European Union may ban</a> the use of this kind of pesticide after a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/05/honey-tests-reveal-global-contamination-by-bee-harming-pesticides">recent study</a> conducted by the Botanical Garden of Neuchâtel, Switzerland revealed the presence of these chemicals in ¾ of honey samples collected. It's been estimated that Germany has lost 75% of its bee populations, while
